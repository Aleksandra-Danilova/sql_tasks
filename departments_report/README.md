## Problem
Generate a report containing the department number, department name, first and last names of employees and the total number of employees in each department.
Sort by department name and employee's first and last name.
There should also be a column with end-to-end numbering of employees in the report, while rows containing the total number of employees (including by departments) should not be numbered.
